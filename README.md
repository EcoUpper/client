# Main funcionality of the project

The aim of this project is to build a full stack web application with CRUD funcionality working with the MERN stack.

To use these technologies, we created and brought to life an application to promote a more sustainable lifestyle and encourage people to reuse and recycle. EcoUpper is also a platform where users can be informed and share their awareness about sustainability and climate change while creating a new community.

## How the platform works
The differents pages are created thinking in the user experience, giving the web the same format.
The stucture in all of them, allows the user to  understand the platform quickly and navigate trough it softly, as the mecanism works in all of the pages the same way: the user gets the upload data updated by date and the option to create new thanks to a simple forms which are dispalyed in a pop up. 
There is also a filtering system to help the user find their needs and in the user profile their will find all the interactions made on the page organized.

The project is presented by four full-stack developer students from Ironhack: Edna, Erik, JuanDa, and Ã“scar. This project was built from scratch.We used React as the foundational backend framework and Mongoose for modeling and database communication. The project incorporates five models that are equipped with validation and user feedback for invalid submissions.

We also created our own db to get the news from two differents newspapaers. (completar)

Furthermore, this website encompasses sign-up, log-in, and log-out functionality, featuring encrypted passwords and/or social logins. We have successfully implemented all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions for models.The project also employs a responsive design to optimize user experience.
